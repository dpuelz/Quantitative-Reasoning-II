## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
cars  = read.csv("../data/cars.csv")
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars$Weight,cars$HighwayMPG,pck=19,cex=0.5)
```

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2 + 2 = 4
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
