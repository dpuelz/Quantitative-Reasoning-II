# Quantitative-Reasoning-II

Welcome to the Winter 2025 edition of Quantitative Reasoning II at UATX!  All course materials can be found on this GitHub page.  Please see the [course syllabus](syllabus.pdf) for links and descriptions of the readings mentioned below.

Instructor:  
- Prof. David Puelz.  Individual meetings can be booked at the following [link](https://calendly.com/dpuelz).  Office hours TBA.


## Class meetings

- Monday and Thursday, from 10:00a-11:15a in classroom 313.

## Exercises

There will be individual, weekly exercises to be turned in via Populi.  They will be posted here and each will consist of two parts: *(i)* Reading and free response questions related to course discussion and material, and *(ii)* Computing exercises from the following [website](https://dtkaplan.github.io/QR2-computing/).

## Software

### WebR (built-in on your browser)

The computing exercises for this course are online activities with R "code blocks" throughout.  These code blocks run entirely in the browser, and you can edit them freely to change the output.  This browser-based version of R is therefore called "WebR."  You will interact with the code blocks and submit your interactions at the end of each computing tutorial.  Please familiarize yourself with the [computing portion](https://dtkaplan.github.io/QR2-computing/) of this course as soon as possible.

### Local R (downloadable software on your computer)

This is optional but highly recommended if you want to get fancy with coding. Please install [R](http://www.r-project.org) and then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer (you want the "RStudio Desktop" version).  Both are free and work on all platforms.  R is the underlying data-analysis program we'll use in this course, while RStudio provides a nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetitive steps (e.g. loading data, saving plots) very simple.
