## Software

Please install [R](http://www.r-project.org) and then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer (you want the "RStudio Desktop" version).  Both are free and work on all platforms.  R is the underlying data-analysis program we'll use in this course, while RStudio provides a nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetitive steps (e.g. loading data, saving plots) very simple.
